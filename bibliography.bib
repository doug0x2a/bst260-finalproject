	abstract = {We present the {INSPIRE} dataset, a publicly available research dataset in
perioperative medicine, which includes approximately 130,000 cases (50\% of all
surgical cases) who underwent anesthesia for surgery at an academic
institution in South Korea between 2011 and 2020. This comprehensive dataset
includes patient characteristics such as age, sex, American Society of
Anesthesiologists physical status classification, diagnosis, surgical
procedure code, department, and type of anesthesia. It also includes vital
signs in the operating theatre, general wards, and intensive care units
({ICUs}), laboratory results from six months before admission to six months
after discharge, and medication during hospitalization. Complications include
total hospital and {ICU} length of stay and in-hospital death. We hope this
dataset will inspire collaborative research and development in perioperative
medicine and serve as a reproducible external validation dataset to improve
surgical outcomes.},

	abstract = {The newly inaugurated Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, which was created under the auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended to stimulate current research and new investigations in the study of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The resource has 3 interdependent components. {PhysioBank} is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. {PhysioToolkit} is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. {PhysioNet} is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to {PhysioBank} data and {PhysioToolkit} software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet. org), {PhysioNet} offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

	abstract = {The American Society of Anesthesiologists ({ASA}) Physical Status classification system celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2021. Its simplicity represents its greatest strength as well as a limitation in a world of comprehensive multisystem tools. It was developed for statistical purposes and not as a surgical risk predictor. However, since it correlates well with multiple outcomes, it is widely used-appropriately or not-for risk prediction and many other purposes. It is timely to review the history and development of the system. The authors describe the controversies surrounding the {ASA} Physical Status classification, including the problems of interrater reliability and its limitations as a risk predictor. Last, the authors reflect on the current status and potential future of the {ASA} Physical Status system.},

	abstract = {To determine if a relationship exists between perioperative myocardial ischemia ({ST} segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 {mV}) and postoperative myocardial infarction ({PMI}), nonparticipating observers recorded all {ECG}, hemodynamic, and other events between arrival of patients in the operating room and onset of cardiopulmonary bypass during 1,023 elective coronary artery bypass operations ({CABG}). The roles of preoperative patient characteristics, quality of the operation limited by disease as rated by the surgeon and duration of ischemic cardiac arrest as risk factors for {PMI} also were quantified. {ECG} ischemia occurred in 36.9\% of all patients, with almost half the episodes occurring before induction of anesthesia. {PMI} was almost three times as frequent in patients with ischemia (6.9\% vs. 2.5\%) and was independent of when ischemia occurred. Ischemia was related significantly to tachycardia but not hypertension nor hypotension and was frequent in the absence of any hemodynamic abnormalities. The anesthesiologist whose patients had the highest rate of tachycardia and ischemia had the highest rate of {PMI}. Although neither single nor multiple preoperative patient characteristics related to {PMI}, suboptimal quality of operation and prolonged ischemic cardiac arrest increased the likelihood of {PMI} independent of the occurrence of myocardial ischemia. The authors conclude that perioperative myocardial ischemia is common in patients undergoing {CABG}, occurs randomly as well as in response to hemodynamic abnormalities, and is one of three independent risk factors the authors identified as related to {PMI}. {PMI} is unrelated to preoperative patient characteristics such as ejection fraction and left main coronary artery disease, and its frequency will relate primarily to perioperative management rather than patient selection.},
